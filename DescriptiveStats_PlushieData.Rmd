## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Today, we will 1) begin using R and R Stuido, and 2) calculate descriptive statistics with the plushie data.

# First, we need to import our data into R Studio so that we can work with it.
# We could directly create vectors for variables in our dataset.

# Create a vector with all the data points for Gorilla 1; Name this vector gor1 .
<<<<<<< HEAD
gor1 <- c(37, 123, 20, 178, 21, 17.5, 6.5, 22)

# Print gor1 in the Console below. Do you see the data you just entered?


# When we get to large datasets, however, entering each datapoint into R manually is impractical and time-consuming (not to mention very annoying). Luckily, we can import whole datasets into R via our spreadsheets!
# The best way to do this is to use a .csv (comma-separated values) file type, because R can easily read these.
# Let's try importing a .csv of our plushie data.

# I have already created the .csv file for you on GitHub. It is called PlushieData.csv .
# To import a .csv file into R, we use the function read.csv() .
# But we need to tell R which file to import and where to find it. There are many ways to do this. We will use a second funtion, file.choose(), which will show you a pop-up window where you can navigate to the PlushieData.csv file on your computer (like in Finder).

#For example, if I had a .csv file with data on primate bones that I wanted to import into R, I could type:
bone.dat <- read.csv(file.choose())
# Then I would press Enter and choose my .csv file from the pop-up window.

# Your turn! Import the PlushieData.csv into R. Call this dataset plush.dat .
<<<<<<< HEAD
plush.dat <- read.csv(file.choose())

# Print plush.dat into the Console below. You should now see your data in the Console, and see plush.dat in the Environment tab to the right. How many variables do you see?
8

# Now that we have our data in R, we can start to play with it.
# In the last few classes, we calculated various descriptive statistics (like mean and standard deviation) by hand. This is annoying and time-consuming! Better to have R do it for us.

# Mean: To calculate the mean (or average) of a variable, we use the funtion mean() . 
# Remember: to select a single variable from a dataset, we use the $ symbol. For example, if I only want the data for Flexion, I write plush.dat$Flexion .

# Calculate the means for each of the 8 variables in plush.dat. Make sure to write down both your code and the answers below:
# For example:
mean(plush.dat$Flexion)
# Answer: 43.25 degrees

<<<<<<< HEAD
mean(plush.dat$Flexion) = 43.25
mean(plush.dat$Extension) = 138.25
mean(plush.dat$Adduction) = 21.25
mean(plush.dat$Abduction) = 178.75
mean(plush.dat$PelvicBreadth) = 20.75
mean(plush.dat$MidthighCircumference) = 17.75
mean(plush.dat$ThighLength) = 7.875
mean(plush.dat$DistanceBetweenKnees) = 25.75

# Median: To calculate the median of a variable, we use the function median() .

# Calculate the medians for each of the 8 variables in plush.dat. Make sure to write down both your code and the answers below:

<<<<<<< HEAD
median(plush.dat$Flexion) = 44
median(plush.dat$Extension) = 137.5
median(plush.dat$Adduction) = 20
median(plush.dat$Abduction) = 178
median(plush.dat$PelvicBreadth) = 21
median(plush.dat$MidthighCircumference) = 17.75
median(plush.dat$ThighLength) = 8
median(plush.dat$DistanceBetweenKnees) = 26

# Range: To calculate the range of a variable, we have to do a little bit more work. We use the min() and max() functions to calculate the minimum and maximum values in the dataset. Then, we subtract the min from the max.

# Calculate the ranges for 4 of the variables in plush.dat. Make sure to write down both your code and the answers below:
# For example:
range.flex <- max(plush.dat$Flexion) - min(plush.dat$Flexion)
range.flex
#Answer: 11 degrees

<<<<<<< HEAD
range.ext <- max(plush.dat$Extension) - min(plush.dat$Extension) = 32
range.ext

range.add <- max(plush.dat$Adduction) - min(plush.dat$Adduction) = 5
range.add

range.abd <- max(plush.dat$Abduction) - min(plush.dat$Abduction) = 3
range.abd

range.pe <- max(plush.dat$PelvicBreadth) - min(plush.dat$PelvicBreadth) = 1
range.pe

# Interquartile Range: To calculate the IQR of a variable, we use the function IQR() .

# Calculate the IQR for each of the 8 variables in plush.dat. Make sure to write down both your code and the answers below:

<<<<<<< HEAD
IQR(plush.dat$Flexion) = 8.75
IQR(plush.dat$Extension) = 29.75
IQR(plush.dat$Adduction) = 1.25

IQR(plush.dat$PelvicBreadth) = 0.25
IQR(plush.dat$MidthighCircumference) = 0.5
IQR(plush.dat$ThighLength) = 2.125

# Variance: To calculate the variance of a variable, we use the function var() .

var(plush.dat$DistanceBetweenKnees) = 14.25


# Standard Deviation: To calculate the SD of a variable, we use the function sd() .

# Calculate the SD for each of the 8 variables in plush.dat. Make sure to write down both your code and the answers below:

sd(plush.dat$Flexion) = 5.619905
sd(plush.dat$Extension) = 17.65172

# Bonus:
# Can you compile all the means for each variable into vectors?

means <- c(mean(plush.dat$Flexion), mean(plush.dat$Extension), mean(plush.dat$Adduction), mean(plush.dat$Abduction), mean(plush.dat$PelvicBreadth), mean(plush.dat$MidthighCircumference), mean(plush.dat$ThighLength), mean(plush.dat$DistanceBetweenKnees))


# Can you combine these mean vectors into a matrix? 



# Can you make vectors and matricies for the other statistics that we calculated above?
